### Role-Playing Scenarios: Create situations where students must respond to emails or online messages. Divide the class into small groups and give each group different scenarios that might require sensitive handling, such as responding to an angry email from a peer, asking for clarification from a teacher, or participating in an online forum discussion. After role-playing, discuss as a class which approaches were respectful and effective and why.
